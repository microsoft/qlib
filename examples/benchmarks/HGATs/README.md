# HGATs
* Hypergraph Attention Networks(HGATs) is build upon GATs by infusing in security-industry information in the form of a hypergraph.
* This code used in Qlib is implemented with PyTorch by ourselves.
* Paper: [Hypergraph Convolution and Hypergraph Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08150.pdf).

Hypergraph information is stored [here](hypergraph).
