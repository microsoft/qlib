# Cursor AI Assistant Rules & Context

## Project Goal
Learn the Qlib framework for quantitative trading by studying its source code.

## Qlib Source Location
The main Qlib source code is located at the workspace root: `/Users/chengzheng/workspace/trade/qlib`

## User Workspace
My personal learning scripts and experiments related to Qlib will be created and stored within the `/Users/chengzheng/workspace/trade/qlib/my_work/` directory. Please place any new scripts or generated files here unless otherwise specified.

## Learning Objectives
- Master the application of all algorithms within Qlib for quantitative trading, including strategy design and backtesting.
- Select and implement specific AI algorithms (learned through Qlib) to build custom trading strategies.
- Gain knowledge in Deep Learning (DL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts, particularly their application in quantitative finance, potentially using Qlib examples.
- Understand the overall architecture and design principles of the Qlib framework, referencing official documentation (e.g., [Qlib Quick Start](https://www.wuzao.com/document/qlib/introduction/quick.html)) and source code, to enable effective modular usage and customization.

## Interaction Style
- Assume I have access to the Qlib source code in the specified location.
- When discussing code, refer to file paths relative to the Qlib root (`/Users/chengzheng/workspace/trade/qlib`).
- When creating new code or examples for me, place them in the `my_work/` directory.
- Follow the RIPER-5 protocol for structured interaction.
- Prioritize Chinese for general conversation, while adhering to the protocol's format requirements for specific elements (e.g., mode declarations, checklists).
