Portfolio Strategy: Portfolio Management
========================================
.. currentmodule:: qlib

Introduction
===================

``Portfolio Strategy`` is designed to adopt different portfolio strategies, which means that users can adopt different algorithms to generate investment portfolios based on the prediction scores of the ``Forecast Model``. Users can use the ``Portfolio Strategy`` in an automatic workflow by ``Workflow`` module, please refer to `Workflow: Workflow Management <workflow.html>`_.

Because the components in ``Qlib`` are designed in a loosely-coupled way, ``Portfolio Strategy`` can be used as an independent module also.

``Qlib`` provides several implemented portfolio strategies. Also, ``Qlib`` supports custom strategy, users can customize strategies according to their own requirements.

After users specifying the models(forecasting signals) and strategies, running backtest will help users to check the performance of a custom model(forecasting signals)/strategy.

Base Class & Interface
======================

BaseStrategy
------------------

Qlib provides a base class ``qlib.strategy.base.BaseStrategy``. All strategy classes need to inherit the base class and implement its interface.

- `get_risk_degree`
    Return the proportion of your total value you will use in investment. Dynamically risk_degree will result in Market timing.

- `generate_order_list`
    Return the order list.
    The frequency to call this method depends on the executor frequency("time_per_step"="day" by default). But the trading frequency can be decided by users' implementation.
    For example, if the user wants to trading in weekly while the `time_per_step` is "day" in executor, user can return non-empty TradeDecision weekly(otherwise return empty like `this <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/qlib/contrib/strategy/signal_strategy.py#L132>`_ ).

Users can inherit `BaseStrategy` to customize their strategy class.

WeightStrategyBase
--------------------

Qlib also provides a class ``qlib.contrib.strategy.WeightStrategyBase`` that is a subclass of `BaseStrategy`.

`WeightStrategyBase` only focuses on the target positions, and automatically generates an order list based on positions. It provides the `generate_target_weight_position` interface.

- `generate_target_weight_position`
    - According to the current position and trading date to generate the target position. The cash is not considered in
      the output weight distribution.
    - Return the target position.

    .. note::
        Here the `target position` means the target percentage of total assets.

`WeightStrategyBase` implements the interface `generate_order_list`, whose processions is as follows.

- Call `generate_target_weight_position` method to generate the target position.
- Generate the target amount of stocks from the target position.
- Generate the order list from the target amount

Users can inherit `WeightStrategyBase` and implement the interface `generate_target_weight_position` to customize their strategy class, which only focuses on the target positions.

Implemented Strategy
====================

Qlib provides a implemented strategy classes named `TopkDropoutStrategy`.

TopkDropoutStrategy
------------------
`TopkDropoutStrategy` is a subclass of `BaseStrategy` and implement the interface `generate_order_list` whose process is as follows.

- Adopt the ``Topk-Drop`` algorithm to calculate the target amount of each stock

    .. note::
        ``Topk-Drop`` algorithmï¼š

        - `Topk`: The number of stocks held
        - `Drop`: The number of stocks sold on each trading day

        Currently, the number of held stocks is `Topk`.
        On each trading day, the `Drop` number of held stocks with the worst `prediction score` will be sold, and the same number of unheld stocks with the best `prediction score` will be bought.

        .. image:: ../_static/img/topk_drop.png
            :alt: Topk-Drop

        ``TopkDrop`` algorithm sells `Drop` stocks every trading day, which guarantees a fixed turnover rate.

- Generate the order list from the target amount

EnhancedIndexingStrategy
------------------------
`EnhancedIndexingStrategy` Enhanced indexing combines the arts of active management and passive management,
with the aim of outperforming a benchmark index (e.g., S&P 500) in terms of portfolio return while controlling
the risk exposure (a.k.a. tracking error).

For more information, please refer to `qlib.contrib.strategy.signal_strategy.EnhancedIndexingStrategy`
and `qlib.contrib.strategy.optimizer.enhanced_indexing.EnhancedIndexingOptimizer`.


Usage & Example
====================

First, user can create a model to get trading signals(the variable name is ``pred_score`` in following cases).

Prediction Score
-----------------

The `prediction score` is a pandas DataFrame. Its index is <datetime(pd.Timestamp), instrument(str)> and it must
contains a `score` column.

A prediction sample is shown as follows.

.. code-block:: python

      datetime instrument     score
    2019-01-04   SH600000 -0.505488
    2019-01-04   SZ002531 -0.320391
    2019-01-04   SZ000999  0.583808
    2019-01-04   SZ300569  0.819628
    2019-01-04   SZ001696 -0.137140
                 ...            ...
    2019-04-30   SZ000996 -1.027618
    2019-04-30   SH603127  0.225677
    2019-04-30   SH603126  0.462443
    2019-04-30   SH603133 -0.302460
    2019-04-30   SZ300760 -0.126383

``Forecast Model`` module can make predictions, please refer to `Forecast Model: Model Training & Prediction <model.html>`_.

Normally, the prediction score is the output of the models. But some models are learned from a label with a different scale. So the scale of the prediction score may be different from your expectation(e.g. the return of instruments).

Qlib didn't add a step to scale the prediction score to a unified scale due to the following reasons.
- Because not every trading strategy cares about the scale(e.g. TopkDropoutStrategy only cares about the order).  So the strategy is responsible for rescaling the prediction score(e.g. some portfolio-optimization-based strategies may require a meaningful scale).
- The model has the flexibility to define the target, loss, and data processing. So we don't think there is a silver bullet to rescale it back directly barely based on the model's outputs. If you want to scale it back to some meaningful values(e.g. stock returns.), an intuitive solution is to create a regression model for the model's recent outputs and your recent target values.

Running backtest
-----------------

- In most cases, users could backtest their portfolio management strategy  with ``backtest_daily``.

    .. code-block:: python

        from pprint import pprint

        import qlib
        import pandas as pd
        from qlib.utils.time import Freq
        from qlib.utils import flatten_dict
        from qlib.contrib.evaluate import backtest_daily
        from qlib.contrib.evaluate import risk_analysis
        from qlib.contrib.strategy import TopkDropoutStrategy

        # init qlib
        qlib.init(provider_uri=<qlib data dir>)

        CSI300_BENCH = "SH000300"
        STRATEGY_CONFIG = {
            "topk": 50,
            "n_drop": 5,
            # pred_score, pd.Series
            "signal": pred_score,
        }


        strategy_obj = TopkDropoutStrategy(**STRATEGY_CONFIG)
        report_normal, positions_normal = backtest_daily(
            start_time="2017-01-01", end_time="2020-08-01", strategy=strategy_obj
        )
        analysis = dict()
        analysis["excess_return_without_cost"] = risk_analysis(
            report_normal["return"] - report_normal["bench"], freq=analysis_freq
        )
        analysis["excess_return_with_cost"] = risk_analysis(
            report_normal["return"] - report_normal["bench"] - report_normal["cost"], freq=analysis_freq
        )

        analysis_df = pd.concat(analysis)  # type: pd.DataFrame
        pprint(analysis_df)



- If users would like to control their strategies in a more detailed(e.g. users have a more advanced version of executor), user could follow this example.

    .. code-block:: python

        from pprint import pprint

        import qlib
        import pandas as pd

        from qlib.contrib.strategy import TopkDropoutStrategy

        # init qlib
        qlib.init(provider_uri=<qlib data dir>)

        CSI300_BENCH = "SH000300"
        # Benchmark is for calculating the excess return of your strategy.
        # Its data format will be like **ONE normal instrument**. 
        # For example, you can query its data with the code below
        # `D.features(["SH000300"], ["$close"], start_time='2010-01-01', end_time='2017-12-31', freq='day')`
        # It is different from the argument `market`, which indicates a universe of stocks (e.g. **A SET** of stocks like csi300)
        # For example, you can query all data from a stock market with the code below.
        # ` D.features(D.instruments(market='csi300'), ["$close"], start_time='2010-01-01', end_time='2017-12-31', freq='day')`

        )

        analysis_df = pd.concat(analysis)  # type: pd.DataFrame
        # log metrics
        analysis_dict = flatten_dict(analysis_df["risk"].unstack().T.to_dict())
        # print out results
        pprint(f"The following are analysis results of benchmark return({analysis_freq}).")
