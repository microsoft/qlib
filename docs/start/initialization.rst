Qlib Initialization
====================

.. currentmodule:: qlib


Initialization
=========================

Please follow the steps below to initialize ``Qlib``.

Download and prepare the Data: execute the following command to download stock data. Please pay `attention` that the data is collected from `Yahoo Finance <https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup>`_ and the data might not be perfect. We recommend users to prepare their own data if they have high-quality datasets. Please refer to `Data <../component/data.html#converting-csv-format-into-qlib-format>`_ for more information about customized dataset.
    
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn
        
Please refer to `Data Preparation <../component/data.html#data-preparation>`_ for more information about `get_data.py`,


Initialize Qlib before calling other APIs: run following code in python.

    .. code-block:: Python

        import qlib
        # region in [REG_CN, REG_US]
        from qlib.constant import REG_CN
        provider_uri = "~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data"  # target_dir
        qlib.init(provider_uri=provider_uri, region=REG_CN)
    
.. note::
   Do not import qlib package in the repository directory  of ``Qlib``, otherwise, errors may occur.

Parameters
-------------------

Besides `provider_uri` and `region`, `qlib.init` has other parameters.
The following are several important parameters of `qlib.init` (`Qlib` has a lot of config. Only part of parameters are limited here. More detailed setting can be found `here <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/main/qlib/config.py>`_):

- `provider_uri`
    Type: str. The URI of the Qlib data. For example, it could be the location where the data loaded by ``get_data.py`` are stored.
- `region`
    Type: str, optional parameter(default: `qlib.constant.REG_CN`).
        Currently: ``qlib.constant.REG_US`` ('us') and ``qlib.constant.REG_CN`` ('cn') is supported. Different value of  `region` will result in different stock market mode.
        - ``qlib.constant.REG_US``: US stock market.
        - ``qlib.constant.REG_CN``: China stock market.

        Different modes will result in different trading limitations and costs.
        The region is just `shortcuts for defining a batch of configurations <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/528f74af099bf6156e9480bcd2bb28e453231212/qlib/config.py#L249>`_, which include minimal trading order unit (``trade_unit``),  trading limitation (``limit_threshold``) , etc.  It is not a necessary part and users can set the key configurations manually if the existing region setting can't meet their requirements.
- `redis_host`
    Type: str, optional parameter(default: "127.0.0.1"), host of `redis`
        The lock and cache mechanism relies on redis.
- `redis_port`
    Type: int, optional parameter(default: 6379), port of `redis`

    .. note:: 
        
        The value of `region` should be aligned with the data stored in `provider_uri`. Currently, ``scripts/get_data.py`` only provides China stock market data. If users want to use the US stock market data, they should prepare their own US-stock data in `provider_uri` and switch to US-stock mode.

    .. note::
        
        If Qlib fails to connect redis via `redis_host` and `redis_port`, cache mechanism will not be used! Please refer to `Cache <../component/data.html#cache>`_ for details.
- `exp_manager`
    Type: dict, optional parameter, the setting of `experiment manager` to be used in qlib. Users can specify an experiment manager class, as well as the tracking URI for all the experiments. However, please be aware that we only support input of a dictionary in the following style for `exp_manager`. For more information about `exp_manager`, users can refer to `Recorder: Experiment Management <../component/recorder.html>`_.
    
    .. code-block:: Python

        # For example, if you want to set your tracking_uri to a <specific folder>, you can initialize qlib below
        qlib.init(provider_uri=provider_uri, region=REG_CN, exp_manager= {
            "class": "MLflowExpManager",
            "module_path": "qlib.workflow.expm",
            "kwargs": {
                "uri": "python_execution_path/mlruns",
                "default_exp_name": "Experiment",
            }
        })
- `mongo`
    Type: dict, optional parameter, the setting of `MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/>`_ which will be used in some features such as `Task Management <../advanced/task_management.html>`_, with high performance and clustered processing. 
    Users need to follow the steps in  `installation <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community>`_  to install MongoDB firstly and then access it via a URI.
    Users can access mongodb with credential by setting "task_url"  to a string like `"mongodb://%s:%s@%s" % (user, pwd, host + ":" + port)`.

    .. code-block:: Python

        # For example, you can initialize qlib below
        qlib.init(provider_uri=provider_uri, region=REG_CN, mongo={
            "task_url": "mongodb://localhost:27017/",  # your mongo url
            "task_db_name": "rolling_db", # the database name of Task Management
        })

- `logging_level`
    The logging level for the system.

- `kernels`
    The number of processes used when calculating features in Qlib's expression engine. It is very helpful to set it to 1 when you are debuggin an expression calculating exception
