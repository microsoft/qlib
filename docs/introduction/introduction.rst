``Qlib`` is an AI-oriented quantitative investment platform, which aims to realize the potential, empower the research, and create the value of AI technologies in quantitative investment.

With ``Qlib``, users can easily try their ideas to create better Quant investment strategies.

At the module level, Qlib is a platform that consists of above components. The components are designed as loose-coupled modules and each component could be used stand-alone.

`Infrastructure` layer    `Infrastructure` layer provides underlying support for Quant research.
                          `DataServer` provides high-performance infrastructure for users to manage 
                          and retrieve raw data. `Trainer` provides flexible interface to control
                          the training process of models which enable algorithms controlling the
                          training process.

`Workflow` layer          `Workflow` layer covers the whole workflow of quantitative investment.
                          `Information Extractor` extracts data for models. `Forecast Model` focuses
                          on producing all kinds of forecast signals (e.g. *alpha*, risk) for other
                          modules.  With these signals `Decision Generator` will generate the target 
                          trading decisions(i.e. portfolio, orders)  to be executed by `Execution Env`
                          (i.e. the trading market).  There may be multiple levels of `Trading Agent`
                          and `Execution Env` (e.g. an *order executor trading agent and intraday
                          order execution environment* could behave like an interday trading
                          environment and nested in  *daily portfolio management trading agent and
                          interday trading environment*  ) 

`Interface` layer         `Interface` layer tries to present a user-friendly interface for the underlying
                          system. `Analyser` module will provide users detailed analysis reports of
                          forecasting signals, portfolios and execution results

- The modules with hand-drawn style are under development and will be released in the future.
- The modules with dashed borders are highly user-customizable and extendible.
