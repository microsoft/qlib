class Trainer:
    """
    Utility to train a policy on a particular task.

    Different from traditional DL trainer, the iteration of this trainer is "collect",
    rather than "epoch", or "mini-batch".
    In each collect, :class:`Collector` collects a number of policy-env interactions, and accumulates
    them into a replay buffer. This buffer is used as the "data" to train the policy.
    At the end of each collect, the policy is *updated* several times.

    The API has some resemblence with `PyTorch Lightning <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/>`__,
    but it's essentially different because this trainer is built for RL applications, and thus
    most configurations are under RL context.
    We are still looking for ways to incorporate existing trainer libraries, because it looks like
    big efforts to build a trainer as powerful as those libraries, and also, that's not our primary goal.

    It's essentially different
    `tianshou's built-in trainers <https://tianshou.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/tianshou.trainer.html>`__,
    as it's far much more complicated than that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_iters
        Maximum iterations before stopping.
    val_every_n_iters
        Perform validation every n iterations (i.e., training collects).
    logger
        Logger to record the backtest results. Logger must be present because
        without logger, all information will be lost.
    finite_env_type
        Type of finite env implementation.
    concurrency
        Parallel workers.
    fast_dev_run
        Create a subset for debugging.
        How this is implemented depends on the implementation of training vessel.
        For :class:`~qlib.rl.vessel.TrainingVessel`, if greater than zero,
        a random subset sized ``fast_dev_run`` will be used
        instead of ``train_initial_states`` and ``val_initial_states``.

    When each iteration of training / validation finishes, metrics will be the aggregation
