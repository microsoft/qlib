OnlineManager can manage a set of `Online Strategy <#Online Strategy>`_ and run them dynamically.

With the change of time, the decisive models will be also changed. In this module, we call those contributing models `online` models.
In every routine(such as every day or every minute), the `online` models may be changed and the prediction of them needs to be updated.
So this module provides a series of methods to control this process.

This module also provides a method to simulate `Online Strategy <#Online Strategy>`_ in history.
Which means you can verify your strategy or find a better one.

There are 4 total situations for using different trainers in different situations:



=========================  ===================================================================================
Situations                 Description
=========================  ===================================================================================
Online + Trainer           When you want to do a REAL routine, the Trainer will help you train the models. It
                           will train models task by task and strategy by strategy.

Online + DelayTrainer      DelayTrainer will skip concrete training until all tasks have been prepared by
                           different strategies. It makes users can parallelly train all tasks at the end of
                           `routine` or `first_train`. Otherwise, these functions will get stuck when each
                           strategy prepare tasks.

Simulation + Trainer       It will behave in the same way as `Online + Trainer`. The only difference is that it
                           is for simulation/backtesting instead of online trading

Simulation + DelayTrainer  When your models don't have any temporal dependence, you can use DelayTrainer
                           for the ability to multitasking. It means all tasks in all routines
                           can be REAL trained at the end of simulating. The signals will be prepared well at
                           different time segments (based on whether or not any new model is online).
=========================  ===================================================================================

Here is some pseudo code the demonstrate the workflow of each situation

For simplicity
    - Only one strategy is used in the strategy
    - `update_online_pred` is only called in the online mode and is ignored

1) `Online + Trainer`

.. code-block:: python

    tasks = first_train()
    models = trainer.train(tasks)
    trainer.end_train(models)
    for day in online_trading_days:
        # OnlineManager.routine
        models = trainer.train(strategy.prepare_tasks())  # for each strategy
        strategy.prepare_online_models(models)  # for each strategy

        trainer.end_train(models)
        prepare_signals()  # prepare trading signals daily


`Online + DelayTrainer`: the workflow is the same as `Online + Trainer`.


2) `Simulation + DelayTrainer`

.. code-block:: python

    # simulate
    tasks = first_train()
    models = trainer.train(tasks)
    for day in historical_calendars:
        # OnlineManager.routine
        models = trainer.train(strategy.prepare_tasks())  # for each strategy
        strategy.prepare_online_models(models)  # for each strategy
    # delay_prepare()
    # FIXME: Currently the delay_prepare is not implemented in a proper way.
    trainer.end_train(<for all previous models>)
    prepare_signals()


# Can we simplify current workflow?
- Can reduce the number of state of tasks?
    - For each task, we have three phases (i.e. task, partly trained task, final trained task)
