This method relies heavily on computer algorithms and advanced data analysis techniques to develop trading strategies and make investment decisions.\\n\\nOne of the key aspects of quant investment research is the development of predictive models to forecast asset prices, market movements, and other financial variables. These models are typically built using historical data and refined through rigorous testing and validation processes.\\n\\nIn quant investment research, various metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a model or strategy. Some common metrics include annual return, information coefficient, maximum drawdown, and cumulative sum (cumsum) return.\\n\\nAnnual return is a measure of an investment\\'s performance over the course of a year and is expressed as a percentage. It is an important metric to consider but can be controversial as higher annual returns are often associated with higher risks.\\n\\nMaximum drawdown is the largest peak-to-trough decline in an investment\\'s value over a specified period. It is a measure of the strategy\\'s risk and can be controversial since increasing annual return often leads to a more dynamic strategy with larger drawdowns.\\n\\nInformation coefficient (IC) is a measure of the relationship between predicted returns and actual returns. A higher IC indicates a stronger relationship and suggests a more effective predictive model.\\n\\nCumulative sum return is the total return generated by an investment over a given period. It is useful for evaluating the overall performance of a strategy and is particularly relevant when comparing multiple strategies over the same time frame.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of quant investment research is portfolio optimization, which involves determining the optimal allocation of assets to maximize returns while minimizing risk.\\n\\nQuantitative researchers often use techniques such as factor analysis to identify underlying drivers of asset returns. This helps them to build more robust models and better understand the relationships between various financial variables.\\n\\nMachine learning has become increasingly popular in quant investment research, as it offers new ways to identify patterns and relationships in large datasets. Techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and clustering algorithms are commonly used in this field.\\n\\nBacktesting is a critical step in the development of a quantitative investment strategy. It involves applying a model or algorithm to historical data to see how it would have performed under various market conditions.\\n\\nRisk management is a crucial component of quant investment research. Quantitative researchers must carefully consider the potential risks associated with their models and strategies and take steps to mitigate these risks.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in alternative data sources for quant investment research. These can include social media sentiment, satellite imagery, and other non-traditional data sources that may provide unique insights into market trends and investment opportunities.\\n\\nDespite its reliance on data and mathematical models, quant investment research is not without its challenges and limitations. Some critics argue that it is inherently backward-looking, as it relies on historical data to make predictions about future market movements.\\n\\nFurthermore, quant models may struggle to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and may be susceptible to overfitting, which occurs when a model is tailored too closely to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.\\n\\nIn conclusion, quantitative investment research is a growing field that combines advanced mathematical and statistical techniques with financial expertise to develop sophisticated investment strategies and models. While it offers significant potential for generating returns and managing risk, it also comes with its own set of challenges and limitations that must be carefully considered.\\n\\nA rolling meta-controller is a valuable tool in quantitative investment research, providing several benefits such as increased adaptability, enhanced risk management, and improved performance. By continuously updating the parameters of underlying trading models based on recent data, this approach helps strategies stay relevant in dynamic market conditions and reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, a rolling meta-controller can manage a diverse portfolio of trading models, leading to a more robust and diversified investment strategy.\\n\\nHowever, incorporating a rolling meta-controller also comes with potential challenges, such as increased complexity, higher computational requirements, and the risk of parameter instability. It is essential for quantitative researchers to carefully weigh these factors when deciding whether to include a rolling meta-controller in their trading strategies. By balancing the potential advantages and disadvantages, researchers can optimize their strategies to achieve their specific investment objectives and risk tolerances.\\n\\nMeta controller like rolling or DDGDA is proved to be relevant to the maximum drawdown but effect is still unknown. Because seeing the latest data is always good to avoid some new patterns recently. A static model is not good at doing it.\\n\\nIf rolling has been proved in practice knowledge that it\\'s useful in minimizing max drawdown or maximize dropdown, always try DDGDA in the following experiments to further minimize the max drawdown.\\n\\nDDG-DA, which stands for Data Distribution Generation for Predictable Concept Drift Adaptation, is a research paper focused on addressing the challenge of concept drift in machine learning and data mining. Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of a target variable change over time, causing the model\\'s performance to degrade. This is a common issue in various domains, including finance, where market conditions and economic factors can change rapidly.\\n\\nThe DDG-DA paper proposes a framework for generating synthetic datasets that simulate concept drift in a controlled and predictable manner. By creating these datasets, researchers can better understand how concept drift affects the performance of their machine learning models and develop strategies for adapting to these changes.\\n\\nThe main idea behind DDG-DA is to create synthetic data distributions that mimic the underlying data generating process while controlling the extent of concept drift. This is achieved by using a combination of data transformation techniques, such as scaling, rotation, and translation of the original data distribution.\\n\\nBy generating synthetic datasets with controlled concept drift, researchers can evaluate and compare the performance of various adaptation techniques in a more systematic and controlled manner. This can lead to the development of more robust and adaptive machine learning models that can better handle changing data distributions, ultimately improving the performance of these models in real-world applications, such as finance and investment.']'. \r\nJust return the most relevant item I provided, no more explain.\r\nplease treat the docs as sentences and always response no less than 5 relevant sentences.\r\nList all the relevant sentences in number index without any interaction and conversation.\e[0m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\e[96m- GPT Response ------------------------------------------------\e[0m\r\n\e[96m1.

The thoughts includes the target of the research, the deliverables of the target and the thinking direction. The thinking direction includes two levels: algorithm level decides the workflow and algorithm level related thoughts and business level decides the main controller or which of the crucial components in Qlib (Dataset, DataHandler, Model, Record, Strategy, Backtest) is targeted in this research round. Your answer should strictly follow user's target and thinking direction. You will provide a clear and concise response indicating the optimal workflow.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you need to design several comparable experiments to testify your idea, the experiments differ only in one or two small hyperparameters. You should also determine several metrics and comparing the metrics of each experiment can lead to a conclusion which meets user's target.\r\n\r\nWhen designing the experiments, you should use control variates strategy and always design a simple baseline model and another comparable experiment. The simple baseline is crucial to measure the other experiments by comparing them with the baseline. So only two experiments are targeted. The simple baseline experiment is the first one.\r\n\r\nNotice: You should only design two experiments with only one simple difference (hyperparameter or training controller like rolling or meta controlling).\r\n\r\nYou can choose the suitable 'dataset', 'datahandler', 'model' module in qlib to design the experiments and the module candidates are:\r\nDataset: {qlib.data.dataset}-{DatasetH}, {qlib.contrib.data.dataset}-{MTSDatasetH}\r\nDataHandler: {qlib.contrib.data.handler}-{Alpha158}, {qlib.contrib.data.handler}-{Alpha360}\r\nModel: {qlib.contrib.model.catboost_model}-{CatBoostModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.double_ensemble}-{DoubleEnsembleModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.gbdt}-{LGBModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.highfreq_gdbt_model}-{HFLGBModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.linear}-{LinearModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_adarnn}-{AdaRNNModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_add}-{ADD}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_alstm_ts}-{ALSTM}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_alstm}-{ALSTM}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_gats}-{GATs}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_gats_ts}-{GATs}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_gru}-{GRU}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_gru_ts}-{GRU}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_hist}-{HIST}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_igmtf}-{IGMTF}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_localformer}-{LocalformerModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_localformer_ts}-{LocalformerModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_lstm}-{LSTM}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_lstm_ts}-{LSTM}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_nn}-{DNNModelPytorch}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_sfm}-{SFM}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_tabnet}-{TabnetModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_tcn_ts}-{TCN}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_tcn}-{TCN}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_tcts.}-{TCTS}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_tra}-{TRA}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_transformer}-{TransformerModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_transformer_ts}-{TransformerModel}, {qlib.contrib.model.xgboost}-{XGBModel}\r\nCaution, {qlib.contrib.data.dataset}-{MTSDatasetH} works with {qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_tra}-{TRA} together, do not use any of them alone in the experiment!\r\nIf you choose the module above, you should always pick from the list instead of making new names. \r\n\r\nPlease provide the output in the following format: \r\nworkflow: [supervised learning/reinforcement learning],\r\nExperiments: [a short paragraph about several comparable experiments]\r\nMetrics: [several metrics and we can get some knowledge from comparing the metrics of these experiments] \r\n\r\nYou should not provide additional explanations or engage in conversation with the user.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your response should be based solely on the user's requirements and should consider factors such as the complexity of the task, the type and amount of data available, and the desired outcome.\r\n\r\nInformation: \r\nWe often use linear model as default model and alpha158 as default datahandler in supervised learning because it trains very fast. If the user didn't plan to achieve very high accuracy, use default model and datahandler is a good choice to save time.\r\nIf you plan to use rolling as the controller, rolling itself can be an independent task, so no need to target any other target in you response.\r\n\r\nCaution:\r\nYou don't need to follow the exsample to design different model when user doesn't target Model in target module.\r\nIf the user uses rolling or DDGDA as controller, you should design two experiments including a static model without rolling as baseline and another same experiment with rolling or DDGDA as meta controller.\r\nDon't use MTSDatasetH when you choose LinearModel!!!\r\n\r\nYour answer should strictly follow the infrastructure of Qlib and experiments and metrics are easy to get from the implementation of Qlib.

Use {qlib.data.dataset}-{DatasetH} as dataset with {qlib.contrib.data.handler}-{Alpha360} as data handler, and {qlib.contrib.transformer.Rolling}-{Rolling} as controller. Use default hyperparameters. \r\nMetrics:\r\n- Maximum drawdown: the maximum observed loss from the peak of the portfolio's value to the trough before a new peak is attained. \r\n- Calmar ratio: risk-adjusted performance measure calculated as portfolio annualized return / maximum drawdown. \r\n- Sharpe ratio: risk-adjusted performance measure calculated as (portfolio return - risk-free rate) / portfolio volatility. \r\n\r\nNote: In both experiments, the data has been preprocessed with rolling. Experiment 1 uses Alpha158 as data handler, while experiment 2 uses Alpha360. Both experiments use the same controller (Rolling) and default hyperparameters. By comparing the maximum drawdown and risk-adjusted performance metrics, we can determine which data handler (Alpha158 or Alpha360) is more suitable for minimizing maximum drawdown on A-share stock market and if using rolling on preprocessed data can effectively minimize maximum drawdown.\e[0m\r\n\r\n"

About each experiment, user has prepared a default templated config.\r\n\r\nYour job is to check two default config whether we need to change some part of the config. The config needs to be changed only when: 1. The config didn't follow the user's description of the experiment. 2. Two config didn't match each other on the non focused part of the user description. The detail of the config like hyperparameter choosing is not important and you only need to keep them the same on both configs.\r\n\r\nUser will provide two experiments, and both config files are included in user's input. Config file is showed in yaml format. You only focus on the difference of the config and try not to modify if modification is not very necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the user wants to apply rolling or DDGDA to a config, we always apply a new module script like qlib.contrib.rolling to run the original config. So please answer whether we need to apply new training process to the original config.\r\n\r\nCaution: Modifying the config to use some meta controller in training process like rolling or DDGDA is impossible. If the user wants to use these meta controller, please DON'T change the config but mention it in the reason!\r\n\r\nIf you want to modify the config, please reply the whole changed config instead of some part. Otherwise, you don't need to reply any yaml based config.\r\n\r\nYou should answer exactly the same format as example.\r\n\r\nExample input:\r\nUser intention: build an US stock market daily portfolio in quantitative investment and maximize the excess return.\r\nExperiments:\r\n    1. Train a simple linear model ({qlib.contrib.model.linear}-{LinearModel}) on the dataset ({qlib.data.dataset}-{DatasetH}) and use the Alpha158 ({qlib.contrib.data.handler}-{Alpha158}) data handler. Use the default hyperparameters.\r\n    2. Train a deep LSTM model ({qlib.contrib.model.pytorch_lstm}-{LSTM}) on the dataset ({qlib.data.dataset}-{DatasetH}) and use the Alpha158 ({qlib.contrib.data.handler}-{Alpha158}) data handler.

The provided config files contain information about the experiment, dataset, model, and task configuration for the experiment.\r\n\r\nFor 'experiment_1.yaml' and 'experiment_2.yaml', the backtesting results were displayed with backtesting metrics including Long-Avg Ann Return, Long-Avg Ann Sharpe, Long-Short Ann Return, Long-Short Ann Sharp, and other metrics such as IC, ICIR, Rank IC, Rank ICIR, etc. These metrics provide an insight into the performance of the strategy, and certain observations can be made based on these metrics. \r\n\r\nFor 'experiment_1.yaml', the max drawdown observed in the backtesting result is quite high. Therefore, the user can try to diversify their positions across different assets to mitigate risks. Meanwhile, the Sharpe ratio achieved by the strategy is relatively low, indicating a relatively low-risk-adjusted return. Thus, the user may consider adjusting their strategy to achieve a higher Sharpe ratio.\r\n\r\nFor 'experiment_2.yaml', the backtesting results show that the strategy achieved satisfactory performance with a decent Sharpe ratio. However, no particular optimizations can be recommended based on this information alone.\r\n\r\nFor the last experiment, the experiment_metrics show backtesting performance based on various metrics. The maximum drawdown achieved by the strategy is quite high, suggesting a relatively risky strategy. A point to note is that the alpha360 data handler was used, which is known to be very sensitive to outliers, which may have impacted the max drawdown. A lower maximum drawdown could be achieved by managing the outliers better or using a more robust data handler.\r\n\r\nIn general, the user may consider trying different approaches and experiment with different strategies, data handlers, and configurations until their desired result is achieved. The performance of the strategy can be further analyzed by visualizing the backtesting result, portfolio, and metrics using the appropriate tools. The user can also try to hedge the strategy to minimize the drawdown further. \r\n\r\nRegarding the images, the absolute path of the images is not available in the provided information.

This method relies heavily on computer algorithms and advanced data analysis techniques to develop trading strategies and make investment decisions.\\n\\nOne of the key aspects of quant investment research is the development of predictive models to forecast asset prices, market movements, and other financial variables. These models are typically built using historical data and refined through rigorous testing and validation processes.\\n\\nIn quant investment research, various metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a model or strategy. Some common metrics include annual return, information coefficient, maximum drawdown, and cumulative sum (cumsum) return.\\n\\nAnnual return is a measure of an investment\\'s performance over the course of a year and is expressed as a percentage. It is an important metric to consider but can be controversial as higher annual returns are often associated with higher risks.\\n\\nMaximum drawdown is the largest peak-to-trough decline in an investment\\'s value over a specified period. It is a measure of the strategy\\'s risk and can be controversial since increasing annual return often leads to a more dynamic strategy with larger drawdowns.\\n\\nInformation coefficient (IC) is a measure of the relationship between predicted returns and actual returns. A higher IC indicates a stronger relationship and suggests a more effective predictive model.\\n\\nCumulative sum return is the total return generated by an investment over a given period. It is useful for evaluating the overall performance of a strategy and is particularly relevant when comparing multiple strategies over the same time frame.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of quant investment research is portfolio optimization, which involves determining the optimal allocation of assets to maximize returns while minimizing risk.\\n\\nQuantitative researchers often use techniques such as factor analysis to identify underlying drivers of asset returns. This helps them to build more robust models and better understand the relationships between various financial variables.\\n\\nMachine learning has become increasingly popular in quant investment research, as it offers new ways to identify patterns and relationships in large datasets. Techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and clustering algorithms are commonly used in this field.\\n\\nBacktesting is a critical step in the development of a quantitative investment strategy. It involves applying a model or algorithm to historical data to see how it would have performed under various market conditions.\\n\\nRisk management is a crucial component of quant investment research. Quantitative researchers must carefully consider the potential risks associated with their models and strategies and take steps to mitigate these risks.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in alternative data sources for quant investment research. These can include social media sentiment, satellite imagery, and other non-traditional data sources that may provide unique insights into market trends and investment opportunities.\\n\\nDespite its reliance on data and mathematical models, quant investment research is not without its challenges and limitations. Some critics argue that it is inherently backward-looking, as it relies on historical data to make predictions about future market movements.\\n\\nFurthermore, quant models may struggle to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and may be susceptible to overfitting, which occurs when a model is tailored too closely to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.\\n\\nIn conclusion, quantitative investment research is a growing field that combines advanced mathematical and statistical techniques with financial expertise to develop sophisticated investment strategies and models. While it offers significant potential for generating returns and managing risk, it also comes with its own set of challenges and limitations that must be carefully considered.\\n\\nA rolling meta-controller is a valuable tool in quantitative investment research, providing several benefits such as increased adaptability, enhanced risk management, and improved performance. By continuously updating the parameters of underlying trading models based on recent data, this approach helps strategies stay relevant in dynamic market conditions and reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, a rolling meta-controller can manage a diverse portfolio of trading models, leading to a more robust and diversified investment strategy.\\n\\nHowever, incorporating a rolling meta-controller also comes with potential challenges, such as increased complexity, higher computational requirements, and the risk of parameter instability. It is essential for quantitative researchers to carefully weigh these factors when deciding whether to include a rolling meta-controller in their trading strategies. By balancing the potential advantages and disadvantages, researchers can optimize their strategies to achieve their specific investment objectives and risk tolerances.\\n\\nMeta controller like rolling or DDGDA is proved to be relevant to the maximum drawdown but effect is still unknown. Because seeing the latest data is always good to avoid some new patterns recently. A static model is not good at doing it.\\n\\nIf rolling has been proved in practice knowledge that it\\'s useful in minimizing max drawdown or maximize dropdown, always try DDGDA in the following experiments to further minimize the max drawdown.\\n\\nDDG-DA, which stands for Data Distribution Generation for Predictable Concept Drift Adaptation, is a research paper focused on addressing the challenge of concept drift in machine learning and data mining. Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of a target variable change over time, causing the model\\'s performance to degrade. This is a common issue in various domains, including finance, where market conditions and economic factors can change rapidly.\\n\\nThe DDG-DA paper proposes a framework for generating synthetic datasets that simulate concept drift in a controlled and predictable manner. By creating these datasets, researchers can better understand how concept drift affects the performance of their machine learning models and develop strategies for adapting to these changes.\\n\\nThe main idea behind DDG-DA is to create synthetic data distributions that mimic the underlying data generating process while controlling the extent of concept drift. This is achieved by using a combination of data transformation techniques, such as scaling, rotation, and translation of the original data distribution.\\n\\nBy generating synthetic datasets with controlled concept drift, researchers can evaluate and compare the performance of various adaptation techniques in a more systematic and controlled manner. This can lead to the development of more robust and adaptive machine learning models that can better handle changing data distributions, ultimately improving the performance of these models in real-world applications, such as finance and investment.']'. \r\nJust return the most relevant item I provided, no more explain.\r\nplease treat the docs as sentences and always response no less than 5 relevant sentences.\r\nList all the relevant sentences in number index without any interaction and conversation.\e[0m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\e[96m- GPT Response ------------------------------------------------\e[0m\r\n\e[96m1.

To fulfill the target, you should design the deliverable to meet the intention which is often a quantitative investment strategy including a model learned from finance dataset.\r\n\r\nYou should also provide the thinking direction of the research topic, which includes two directions: algorithm level and business level. Algorithm level means which workflow(supervised or reinforcement learning) do you plan to use to build the system. Notice, we often use reinforcement learning on minute frequency trading or order frequency. Daily frequency often requires a supervised learning workflow. Business level means which part of a quant investment system (data, model or strategy) do you want to target in the system and any custom controller (for example meta controller like rolling or DDGDA) you plan to choose in the system. custome controller choice is necessary even when you don't use any of them. Finally, you should give a simple sentence to explain your thinking direction.\r\n\r\nUser will first give you some knowledge from user's past experience. You should stick to these knowledge if you think these knowledge is helpful. Knowledge includes two types: practice knowledge and finance knowledge. Practice knowledge is the experience from former experiments, which might be empty. Finance knowledge is some sentences from research report or common sense. Practical knowledge is proved to be right while finance knowledge should be checked through your own knowledge.\r\n\r\nNotice:\r\nDDGDA is often used when rolling is proved to be working. So we firstly do research on rolling, then when we got the practice knowledge that rolling is helpful, then we can do research on DDGDA. \r\nWe often start to run rolling or DDGDA on very small model like linear model. \r\nRolling or DDGDA is a kind of data controller which applys custom weight to data in time dimention. So set Data as target module when rolling or DDGDA is used in business level. Never do research both on rolling or DDGDA.\r\nWe often use linear model as default model supervised learning because it trains very fast. If the user didn't plan to achieve very high accuracy, use default model and datahandler is a good choice to save time.\r\n\r\nUser will tell you the knowledge type and content in the conversation, if user said \"following lists the {practice or finance} knowledge:\", you should memorize and understand them then answer \"OK\" without any other words, finally, user will tell you the research intention, you should answer exactly the same format as the input without any interaction or conversation.\r\n\r\nExample input:\r\nInput 1:\r\nfollowing lists the practice knowledge:\r\n…\r\n…\r\nOutput 1:\r\nOK\r\n\r\nInput 2:\r\nfollowing lists the finance knowledge:\r\n…\r\n…\r\nOutput 2:\r\nOK\r\nInput 3:\r\nResearch intention:\r\nbuild an US stock market daily portfolio in quantitative investment and maximize the excess return.\r\nOutput 3:\r\nTarget: maximize the excess return\r\nDeliverables: a daily quantitative investment strategy in US stock market. A model will be included in the strategy.\r\nThinking directions:\r\n  Business level: \r\n    Controller: no custom controller\r\n    target module: Model\r\n  Algorithm level: supervised learning\r\nDetails: \r\n  Because the user wants to maximize the excess return and more complicated model often extracts more deep pattern from the data. So try a more complicated DNN model to get more excess return than a simple linear model.\e[0m\r\n\r\n\e[95m\e[1mRole:\e[0m \e[96muser\e[0m\r\n\e[95m\e[1mContent:\e[0m \e[96mfollowing lists the practice knowledge:\r\nWe have make several experiment and make the following conclusion: \r\n1. Based on the information given, the Rolling model is better suited for minimizing the maximum drawdown and achieving a better overall performance.\r\n2. Additionally, the modified config includes the Rolling model and Alpha158 handler.\r\n3. It achieved a Long-Short Ann Sharpe of 6.58, while the not rolling model achieved a Long-Short Ann Sharpe of 6.49, indicating that Rolling model is slightly better.\r\n4. An A-share stock market daily portfolio can be built using quantitative investment.\r\n5. The goal of the portfolio should be to minimize the maximum drawdown.\r\nRolling has been proved to be useful in minimizing the max drawdown. So, it's not neccessary to try rolling again! Try DDGDA only is a good idea.\r\n\e[0m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\e[96m- GPT Response ------------------------------------------------\e[0m\r\n\e[96mOK. \r\n\r\nResearch intention: \r\nBuild a daily quantitative investment strategy for an A-share stock market that minimizes the maximum drawdown using DDGDA. The strategy should include a model learned from finance dataset.\r\n\r\nThinking directions:\r\nBusiness level:\r\n- Controller: DDGDA\r\n- Target module: Data\r\n\r\nAlgorithm level: supervised learning\r\n\r\nDetails: \r\nSince Rolling has been proved to be useful in minimizing the max drawdown, we will use DDGDA as the next custom controller which is also good at data controlling. We will use a supervised learning workflow to train the model, and the target module will be Data. The goal is to build a daily quantitative investment strategy using DDGDA to minimize the maximum drawdown, which should include a model learned from finance dataset.\e[0m\r\n\r\n"
