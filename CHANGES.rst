Version 0.3.5
--------------------
- Support multi-label training, you can provide multiple label in ``handler``. (But LightGBM doesn't support due to the algorithm itself)
- Refactor ``handler`` code, dataset.py is no longer used, and you can deploy your own labels and features in ``feature_label_config``
- Handler only offer DataFrame. Also, ``trainer`` and model.py only receive DataFrame
- Change ``split_rolling_data``, we roll the data on market calendar now, not on normal date
- Move some date config from ``handler`` to ``trainer``

Version 0.4.0
--------------------
- Add `data` package that holds all data-related codes
- Reform the data provider structure
- Create a server for data centralized management `qlib-server<https://amc-msra.visualstudio.com/trading-algo/_git/qlib-server>`_
- Add a `ClientProvider` to work with server
- Add a pluggable cache mechanism
- Add a recursive backtracking algorithm to inspect the furthest reference date for an expression

.. note::
    The ``D.instruments`` function does not support ``start_time``, ``end_time``, and ``as_list`` parameters, if you want to get the results of previous versions of ``D.instruments``, you can do this:


    >>> from qlib.data import D
    >>> instruments = D.instruments(market='csi500')
    >>> D.list_instruments(instruments=instruments, start_time='2015-01-01', end_time='2016-02-15', as_list=True)


Version 0.4.1
--------------------
- Add support Windows
- Fix ``instruments`` type bug
- Fix ``features`` is empty bug(It will cause failure in updating)
- Fix ``cache`` lock and update bug
- Fix use the same cache for the same field (the original space will add a new cache)
- Change "logger handler" from config
- Change model load support 0.4.0 later
- The default value of the ``method`` parameter of ``risk_analysis`` function is changed from **ci** to **si**


Version 0.4.2
--------------------
- Refactor DataHandler
- Add ``Alpha360`` DataHandler


Version 0.4.3
--------------------
- Implementing Online Inference and Trading Framework
- Refactoring The interfaces of backtest and strategy module.


Version 0.4.4
--------------------
- Optimize cache generation performance
- Add report module
- Fix bug when using ``ServerDatasetCache`` offline.
- In the previous version of ``long_short_backtest``, there is a case of ``np.nan`` in long_short. The current version ``0.4.4`` has been fixed, so ``long_short_backtest`` will be different from the previous version.
- In the ``0.4.2`` version of ``risk_analysis`` function, ``N`` is ``250``, and ``N`` is ``252`` from ``0.4.3``, so ``0.4.2`` is ``0.002122`` smaller than the ``0.4.3`` the backtest result is slightly different between ``0.4.2`` and ``0.4.3``.
- refactor the argument of backtest function.
    - **NOTE**:
      - The default arguments of topk margin strategy is changed. Please pass the arguments explicitly if you want to get the same backtest result as previous version.
      - The TopkWeightStrategy is changed slightly. It will try to sell the stocks more than ``topk``.  (The backtest result of TopkAmountStrategy remains the same)
- The margin ratio mechanism is supported in the Topk Margin strategies.


Version 0.4.5
--------------------
- Add multi-kernel implementation for both client and server.
    - Support a new way to load data from client which skips dataset cache.
    - Change the default dataset method from single kernel implementation to multi kernel implementation.
- Accelerate the high frequency data reading by optimizing the relative modules.
- Support a new method to write config file by using dict.

Version 0.4.6
--------------------
- Some bugs are fixed
    - The default config in `Version 0.4.5` is not friendly to daily frequency data.
    - Backtest error in TopkWeightStrategy when `WithInteract=True`.

    - Add baselines
    - public data crawler


Version 0.8.0

    - Nested decision execution framework is supported
    - There are lots of changes for daily trading, it is hard to list all of them. But a few important changes could be noticed
        - The trading limitation is more accurate;
            - In `previous version <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/v0.7.2/qlib/contrib/backtest/exchange.py#L160>`_, longing and shorting actions share the same action.
            - In `current version <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/7c31012b507a3823117bddcc693fc64899460b2a/qlib/backtest/exchange.py#L304>`_, the trading limitation is different between logging and shorting action.
        - The constant is different when calculating annualized metrics.
            - `Current version <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/7c31012b507a3823117bddcc693fc64899460b2a/qlib/contrib/evaluate.py#L42>`_ uses more accurate constant than `previous version <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/v0.7.2/qlib/contrib/evaluate.py#L22>`_
        - `A new version <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/blob/7c31012b507a3823117bddcc693fc64899460b2a/qlib/tests/data.py#L17>`_ of data is released. Due to the unstability of Yahoo data source, the data may be different after downloading data again.
        - Users could check out the backtesting results between  `Current version <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/7c31012b507a3823117bddcc693fc64899460b2a/examples/benchmarks>`_ and `previous version <https://github.com/microsoft/qlib/tree/v0.7.2/examples/benchmarks>`_
